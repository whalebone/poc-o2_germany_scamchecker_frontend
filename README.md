# O₂ Germany – Scam Checker (frontend PoC)

Static frontend built with [Vite](https://vite.dev): plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hosted on Netlify — every push to `dev` deploys automatically. Work happens on `dev` for now; `main` only accepts pull requests. The backend is a separate project.

## What it does

One mobile-first page in O₂ design, in German and English (DE/EN switch, or `?lang=en`):

1. Paste a suspicious SMS, e-mail or chat message, or tap **Beispiel einfügen** for the demo example. Then tap **Jetzt prüfen**.
2. The answer: verdict, why, what to do now, and the 116 116 card-blocking number in case you already entered details.
3. Feedback (thumbs up/down plus an optional reason) is tied to the answer's `request_id`.
4. If the link is already in the domain database, the page says that O₂ Onlineschutz would have blocked it, with a link to the Onlineschutz page.
5. For a common scam, a card asks you to warn others: the native share sheet on phones, WhatsApp, e-mail or copy elsewhere.

The camera button only shows a "coming soon" popup for now. The backend is mocked in `src/demo.js` with a single demo case. Any other text shows a short demo notice.

## Run locally

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 or newer (LTS).

**Windows:** double-click `runapp.bat`. It installs dependencies, starts the dev server in the background and opens http://localhost:5180 in your browser. Edits show up live. Double-click `shutdown.bat` to stop it. Server output goes to `dev-server.log`.

**Any OS:**

```sh
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5180 with live reload
npm run build     # production build in dist/
npm run preview   # serve dist/ locally
```

## Deploy

Netlify reads `netlify.toml` (build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`, Node 22). One-time setup: in Netlify, choose **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub**, pick this repository, set the production branch to `dev` and keep the other detected settings.
